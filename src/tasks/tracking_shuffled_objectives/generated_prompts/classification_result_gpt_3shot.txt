The task involves multiple steps of partner swapping and keeping track of who is dancing with whom. In this case, the variables tracking approach would be more effective as it allows for a systematic way of keeping track of the partners and their movements throughout the dance. By using variables to represent each dancer and their current partner, it becomes easier to follow the sequence of partner swaps and determine the final pairings. Therefore, the answer is Variables tracking.
