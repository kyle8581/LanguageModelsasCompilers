Explanation:
This task involves tracking the swapping of objects (like balls or dance partners) between individuals over a series of exchanges. The goal is to determine the final state of these objects after all swaps are completed. This requires careful tracking of each swap and updating the state of each object accordingly.

Analyzing the Task:
1. Tracking Initial States: The initial state of each object (who has what or who is with whom) needs to be recorded. 

2. Understanding Swap Sequences: The sequence of swaps described in the text must be clearly understood and recorded. Each swap alters the state of the objects.

3. Sequentially Updating States: For each swap, the states of the involved objects must be updated to reflect the exchange.

4. Identifying the Final Query: After all swaps, the question usually asks for the final state of a particular object or individual.

Constructing the Code Prompt:
1. Identifying Initial State: Parse the input text to determine the initial state of all objects or individuals. This step sets the foundation for the entire process.

2. Parsing Swap Sequences: Extract the sequence of swaps from the input text. Each swap will need to be processed in the order they occur.

3. [Important] Executing Swaps: Iterate over each swap sequence and update the states of the objects or individuals involved in each swap. This is a crucial step that ensures the current state is always up-to-date.

4. Extracting the Final Question: After processing all swaps, identify the specific question asked in the input text.

5. Examining Options: Review and display the options provided in the input text for the final question.

6. Determining the Answer: Based on the final state of the objects or individuals, select the correct option that answers the question.
