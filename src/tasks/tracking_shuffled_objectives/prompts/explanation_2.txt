This task involves tracking the swapping of objects (like balls or dance partners) between individuals over a series of exchanges. The goal is to determine the final state of these objects after all swaps are completed. This requires careful tracking of each swap and updating the state of each object accordingly.

Analyzing the Task:
It is important to keep track of the state of each object's or individual's state while processing the swap seqeunces. Therefore, the variables tracking will be effective way to solve the task.

Constructing the Code Prompt:
1. Identifying Initial State: Parse the input text to determine the initial state of all objects or individuals. This step sets the foundation for the entire process.

2. Parsing Swap Sequences: Extract the sequence of swaps from the input text. Each swap will need to be processed in the order they occur.

3. [Variables tracking] Executing Swaps: Iterate over each swap sequence by using 'for loop' and update the states of the objects or individuals involved in each swap. Print out the current and updated states to track the swaps.

4. Extracting the Final Question: After processing all swaps, identify the specific question asked in the input text.

5. Examining Options: Review and display the options provided in the input text for the final question.

6. Determining the Answer: Based on the final state of the objects or individuals, select the correct option that answers the question.
