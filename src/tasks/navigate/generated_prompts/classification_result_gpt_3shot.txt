For these tasks, the key is to follow the sequence of steps and determine if they lead back to the starting point. This requires tracking the movements and directions taken throughout the instructions. Therefore, the variables tracking method would be more effective in solving these problems as it allows for a systematic approach to keep track of the movements and directions. So the answer is Variables tracking.
