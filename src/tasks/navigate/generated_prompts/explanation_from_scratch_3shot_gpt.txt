Explanation:
This task involves following a series of instructions related to movement and direction to determine if the final position is the same as the starting point. The challenge lies in accurately tracking the movements and rotations to deduce the final position.

Analyzing the Task:
1. Movement Tracking: Keep track of the steps taken in each direction (forward, backward, left, right) to determine the final position.

2. Directional Changes: Account for any rotations (turning left or right) that may alter the orientation during movement.

3. Spatial Reasoning: Apply logical reasoning to calculate the final position based on the cumulative effect of the movements and rotations.

Constructing the Code Prompt:
1. Extracting Instructions: Parse the input text to extract the sequence of movements and rotations.

2. Processing Movements:
   - Initialize variables to track the current position (x, y coordinates) and orientation (direction faced).
   - Iterate over each instruction, updating the position and orientation accordingly.

3. [Important] Determining the Final Position:
   - Calculate the final position based on the cumulative effect of movements and rotations.
   - Check if the final position matches the starting point to determine if the participant returns to the starting point.

4. Matching with Options: Compare the final position with the starting point to determine if the participant returns to the starting point.

5. Returning the Final Answer: Output 'Yes' if the participant returns to the starting point, 'No' otherwise.
