Generate the code prompt for the last task using the similar style of the example codes. Add enough print() functions following the provided steps  in the provided explanation to output intermediate reasoning steps towards the answer and keep track of important variables. Implement the code prompt as much as you can and describe the logic in code following the provided explanation but do not make a code that is biased toward a single task example instance. For example, do not use hard-coded variables that are obtained from task instances (e.g., using specific name of person in the question). The code prompt must be able to be applied to various instances of same task. When returning the final answer, carefully consider the output format. Especially, for the multiple choice questions, the final answer should be one of the given options. The main function name should be 'ends_up_at_start'. Along with the main function, you may want to define some helper functions that might be helpful for implementing the 'ends_up_at_start'. But you don't have to explicitly implement the helper functions, but just define them with function name and a single-line explanation in comment.

Output Format:
'(A)', '(B)', '(C)', ...\Explanation:
The task involves determining the time slots when individuals could have performed a specific activity, based on a series of observations that define where they were seen at various times throughout the day. This requires logical reasoning to deduce the only time slot where the individual was unaccounted for and thus could have performed the said activity.

Analyzing the Task:
1.Sequential Events and Time Slots: Each example consists of sequential events occurring at different times. The goal is to find a time slot not occupied by any known activity.

2.Identifying Time Intervals: The time intervals during which each activity occurred are crucial. We need to understand and process these intervals to figure out the free slot.

3.Eliminating Occupied Time Slots: By systematically ruling out the time slots during which the person was seen engaging in other activities, we can identify the potential free slot.

Constructing the Code Prompt:
1.Breaking Down the Input: The first step involves parsing the input text to separate the statements about activities and the time options. This involves string manipulation to extract relevant parts of the text.

2.Identifying Time Constraints: The start and end of possible times for the unaccounted activity (e.g., the time when the person woke up and the time by which the location of interest was closed) need to be identified. This helps in setting the boundaries for our search.

3.Initializing an Available Time Map: To keep track of which time slots are occupied and which are free, an available time map (a dictionary in Python) is initialized with time slots marked as 'free' initially. This map will be updated as more information is processed.

4.Processing Each Statement: For each activity mentioned in the statements, the corresponding time span needs to be marked as 'occupied' in the available time map. While iterating over the statements, process each statement and update the time map. Note that time map should be printed out at each step to logging the results. This involves:
 - Extracting time information from each statement (using a function like extract_information).
 - Updating the available time map accordingly.
5. Determining the Free Time Slot: After all statements are processed, the time slot that remains marked as 'free' in the map is the one where the individual could have performed the activity in question.

6. Matching with Provided Options: Finally, the free time slot is matched against the provided options to identify the correct answer.

Output Format:
'Yes' or 'No'\Explanation:
Explanation:
This task involves evaluating a series of statements regarding truthfulness and deceit to determine the veracity of a final claim. It is a logical puzzle that requires tracking the assertions about each individual's honesty and then applying this information to deduce a final conclusion.

Analyzing the Task:
1. Statement Analysis: Each statement provides information about one person's opinion on another's truthfulness. These need to be carefully analyzed to understand their implications.

2. Truth Mapping: A method to keep track of what is known about each person's truthfulness is essential. This can be handled with a dictionary (or map) where keys are individuals' names and values are their assumed truthfulness.

3. Logical Deduction: Based on the statements, logical deductions must be made to update the truth map. This involves understanding the implications of each statement in the context of the existing information.

4. Resolving the Final Query: The final step is to use the truth map to answer the specific question asked, based on the accumulated knowledge about each individual's truthfulness.

Constructing the Code Prompt:
1. Parsing Statements and Question: First, divide the input text into individual statements and the final question. This requires string manipulation.

2. Creating a Truth Map: Initialize a map to keep track of each person's truthfulness status. Initially, the truthfulness of each individual might be unknown.

3. [Important] Analyzing Statements: Iterate over each statement to extract the relevant information: who is making the statement, who it is about, and whether it asserts that the second person is truthful or deceitful.

4. [Important] Updating the Truth Map: Use the information from each statement to update the truth map. This might involve setting or revising the truth status of one or more individuals.

5. Evaluating the Final Question: Use the information in the truth map to determine the truthfulness of the person in question.

6. Returning the Conclusion: Based on the evaluation, return 'Yes' if the person in the final question is determined to be truthful, or 'No' otherwise.

Explanation:
This task involves tracking the swapping of objects (like balls or dance partners) between individuals over a series of exchanges. The goal is to determine the final state of these objects after all swaps are completed. This requires careful tracking of each swap and updating the state of each object accordingly.

Analyzing the Task:
1. Tracking Initial States: The initial state of each object (who has what or who is with whom) needs to be recorded. 

2. Understanding Swap Sequences: The sequence of swaps described in the text must be clearly understood and recorded. Each swap alters the state of the objects.

3. Sequentially Updating States: For each swap, the states of the involved objects must be updated to reflect the exchange.

4. Identifying the Final Query: After all swaps, the question usually asks for the final state of a particular object or individual.

Constructing the Code Prompt:
1. Identifying Initial State: Parse the input text to determine the initial state of all objects or individuals. This step sets the foundation for the entire process.

2. Parsing Swap Sequences: Extract the sequence of swaps from the input text. Each swap will need to be processed in the order they occur.

3. [Important] Executing Swaps: Iterate over each swap sequence and update the states of the objects or individuals involved in each swap. This is a crucial step that ensures the current state is always up-to-date.

4. Extracting the Final Question: After processing all swaps, identify the specific question asked in the input text.

5. Examining Options: Review and display the options provided in the input text for the final question.

6. Determining the Answer: Based on the final state of the objects or individuals, select the correct option that answers the question.

Code prompt:
def track_swaps(input_text):
    # Step 1: Identify Initial State. Begin by identifying and outputing the initial state of all objectives (e.g., who holds which ball or who is dancing with whom) from the input text before any swaps happen.
    state_dict = find_initial_state(input_text)
    print(f"Initial state: {state_dict}")

    # Step 2: Identify and output the sequences of swaps from the input text. Each swap should be understood in terms of who exchanges with whom.
    swap_sequences_list = find_swap_sequences(input_text)
    print("Swap sequences: ", swap_sequences_list)
    print("Total iterations: ", len(swap_sequences_list))

    # Step 3: Carry out the swaps. For each swap in swap sequences, sequentially update and output the current status of objectives by exchanging them between the two participants involved in the swap.
    for i, sequence in enumerate(swap_sequences_list):
        player1, player2 = extract_player(sequence)
        state_dict[player1], state_dict[player2] = state_dict[player2], state_dict[player1]
        print(f"({i}) {sequence} -> {state_dict}")

    Step 4: Understand the Question. After processing all swaps, identify what the question is asking for in the input text and output the question.
    question = extract_question(input_text)
    print("Question:", question)

    Step 5: Analyze Options. Examine and output the provided options in the input text.
    options = input_text.split("\n")[-5:]
    print("Options:", options)

    Step 6: Determine the Correct Option. Using the updated state after all swaps, determine which option correctly answers the question and output the answer.

Output Format:
'Yes' or 'No'\Explanation:
Explanation:
This task involves following a series of instructions related to movement and direction to determine if the final position is the same as the starting point. The challenge lies in accurately tracking the movements and rotations to deduce the final position.

Analyzing the Task:
1. Movement Tracking: Keep track of the steps taken in each direction (forward, backward, left, right) to determine the final position.

2. Directional Changes: Account for any rotations (turning left or right) that may alter the orientation during movement.

3. Spatial Reasoning: Apply logical reasoning to calculate the final position based on the cumulative effect of the movements and rotations.

Constructing the Code Prompt:
1. Extracting Instructions: Parse the input text to extract the sequence of movements and rotations.

2. Processing Movements:
   - Initialize variables to track the current position (x, y coordinates) and orientation (direction faced).
   - Iterate over each instruction, updating the position and orientation accordingly.

3. [Important] Determining the Final Position:
   - Calculate the final position based on the cumulative effect of movements and rotations.
   - Check if the final position matches the starting point to determine if the participant returns to the starting point.

4. Matching with Options: Compare the final position with the starting point to determine if the participant returns to the starting point.

5. Returning the Final Answer: Output 'Yes' if the participant returns to the starting point, 'No' otherwise.
