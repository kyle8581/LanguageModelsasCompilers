For these tasks, the key is to ensure that the parentheses are closed properly in the given sequences. This requires a systematic approach to keep track of the opening and closing parentheses. Therefore, the variables tracking method, using a for loop to process each character in the sequence and keeping track of the opening and closing parentheses, would be more effective in solving these tasks. So the answer is Variables tracking.
