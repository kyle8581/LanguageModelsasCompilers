This task involves completing a sequence of parentheses to ensure they are closed properly. The challenge is to understand the nesting structure of the parentheses and add the appropriate closing brackets to match each opening bracket.

Analyzing the Task:
1. Parentheses Matching: Each opening parenthesis should have a corresponding closing parenthesis to ensure the sequence is valid.

2. Nested Parentheses: The parentheses can be nested within each other, so it's crucial to maintain the correct nesting structure.

3. Proper Closure: The goal is to add the necessary closing brackets to complete the sequence and make sure all parentheses are closed properly.

Constructing the Code Prompt:
1. Parsing Input: Extract the sequence of parentheses from the input text.

2. Stack Implementation: Use a stack data structure to keep track of the opening parentheses that need closing.

3. Iterating Over the Sequence: Iterate over each character in the sequence and push opening parentheses onto the stack.

4. [Important] Closing Parentheses: When encountering a closing parenthesis, pop the corresponding opening parenthesis from the stack to ensure proper closure.

5. Generating Output: After processing the entire sequence, the stack should be empty if all parentheses are closed properly. If not, add the necessary closing brackets to match the remaining opening brackets.

6. Returning the Result: Output the generated closing brackets as a string, separated by spaces, to complete the sequence.
