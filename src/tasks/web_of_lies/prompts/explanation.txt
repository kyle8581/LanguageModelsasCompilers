Explanation:
This task involves evaluating a series of statements regarding truthfulness and deceit to determine the veracity of a final claim. It is a logical puzzle that requires tracking the assertions about each individual's honesty and then applying this information to deduce a final conclusion.

Analyzing the Task:
1. Statement Analysis: Each statement provides information about one person's opinion on another's truthfulness. These need to be carefully analyzed to understand their implications.

2. Truth Mapping: A method to keep track of what is known about each person's truthfulness is essential. This can be handled with a dictionary (or map) where keys are individuals' names and values are their assumed truthfulness.

3. Logical Deduction: Based on the statements, logical deductions must be made to update the truth map. This involves understanding the implications of each statement in the context of the existing information.

4. Resolving the Final Query: The final step is to use the truth map to answer the specific question asked, based on the accumulated knowledge about each individual's truthfulness.

Constructing the Code Prompt:
1. Parsing Statements and Question: First, divide the input text into individual statements and the final question. This requires string manipulation.

2. Creating a Truth Map: Initialize a map to keep track of each person's truthfulness status. Initially, the truthfulness of each individual might be unknown.

3. [Important] Analyzing Statements: Iterate over each statement to extract the relevant information: who is making the statement, who it is about, and whether it asserts that the second person is truthful or deceitful.

4. [Important] Updating the Truth Map: Use the information from each statement to update the truth map. This might involve setting or revising the truth status of one or more individuals.

5. Evaluating the Final Question: Use the information in the truth map to determine the truthfulness of the person in question.

6. Returning the Conclusion: Based on the evaluation, return 'Yes' if the person in the final question is determined to be truthful, or 'No' otherwise.
