The task involves determining the time slots when individuals could have performed a specific activity, based on a series of observations that define where they were seen at various times throughout the day. This requires logical reasoning to deduce the only time slot where the individual was unaccounted for and thus could have performed the said activity.

Analyzing the Task:
To check and update possible time slots mentioned in each of the statement, it is necessary to take a variables tracking to keep track of the changes in the time slots.

Constructing the Code Prompt:
1. Breaking Down the Input: The first step involves parsing the input text to separate the statements about activities and the time options.

2. Identifying Time Constraints: The start and end of possible times for the unaccounted activity (e.g., the time when the person woke up and the time by which the location of interest was closed) need to be identified. This helps in setting the boundaries for our search.

3. Initializing an Available Time Map: To keep track of which time slots are occupied and which are free, an available time map (a dictionary in Python) is initialized with time slots from options marked as 'free' initially.

4. [Variables tracking] Processing Each Statement: Sequentially go through each statement by using 'for loop', marking the time span when the individual was seen or known to be engaged in specific activities as 'not available' at the time map. Following things should be logged with print() function for each intermediate steps:
- Each statement to process
- Current time map
- Time span specified in the statement
- Updated time map

5. Determining the Free Time Slot: After all statements are processed, the time slot that remains marked as 'free' in the map is the one where the individual could have performed the activity in question.

6. Matching with Provided Options: Finally, the free time slot is matched against the provided options to identify the correct answer.
