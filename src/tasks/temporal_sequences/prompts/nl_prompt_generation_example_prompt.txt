[Example 1]
Example task instances:
Sort the following words alphabetically: List: plebiscite colombo inviolate quagmire garry satanic magnanimity aeneas notoriety nevada foothold glycerine lucre tennyson type scription pompey softball spleenwort fox

Sort the following words alphabetically: List: stitch steelmake indomitable wigging cubby sheaf pique thymine exotica good mental brake nick rajah lineage choose bunny drone chevalier

Sort the following words alphabetically: List: dynastic inflammable prick tristan vitiate tackle stagnate conglomerate nebulae phosphide

Output Format:
A string of words seperated with a space

Explanation:
This task involves sorting a list of words alphabetically. It is a straightforward task that requires the application of standard sorting techniques.

Analyzing the Task:
1. Word Extraction: Initially, the words need to be separated from the input text. 

2. Alphabetical Sorting: The core of the task is to sort these words based on their alphabetical order.

3. Returning the Sorted List: The final step is to output the list of words in the sorted order.

Constructing the Code Prompt:
1. Splitting the Text into Words: First, extract each word from the input text. This can be achieved through string splitting based on spaces.

2. Identifying Starting Letters: Though not strictly necessary for sorting, extracting the first letter of each word can help in understanding how the sorting will proceed.

3. Sorting the Words: Use a standard sorting algorithm or function to sort the words alphabetically. In most programming languages, there are built-in functions that can handle this step efficiently.

4. Outputting the Sorted List: Finally, return the list of words in their sorted order.

[Example 2]
Example task instances:
Complete the rest of the sequence, making sure that the parentheses are closed properly. Input: [ ( < { [ ( ) ] } >

Complete the rest of the sequence, making sure that the parentheses are closed properly. Input: ( < { ( ) { } } ( < > ) >

Complete the rest of the sequence, making sure that the parentheses are closed properly. Input: [ < < { } > < > > ( )

Output Format:
A string of closing brakets seperated with a space.

Explanation:
This task involves completing a sequence of opening and closing parentheses, ensuring that they are correctly matched and the entire sequence is well-formed. This is a classic problem in computer science related to parsing and syntactic analysis, often solved using stack data structures.

Analyzing the Task:
1. Parentheses Matching: Each opening parenthesis must have a corresponding closing one. The sequence must adhere to the proper nesting and order of parentheses.

2. Tracking Open Parentheses: A stack is ideal for keeping track of open parentheses, as it allows us to process them in a last-in, first-out (LIFO) manner.

3. Completing the Sequence: The goal is to add the appropriate closing parentheses to complete the sequence.

Constructing the Code Prompt:
1. Initialize a Stack: Use a stack to keep track of opening parentheses. This is crucial for understanding which parentheses are open and need closing.

2. Split and Parse Input: Split the input string into individual characters for easy processing. Identify types of parentheses and their corresponding closing counterparts.

3. [Important] Iterate and Process Characters: Iterate over the input characters. To keep track of the stack, make sure printing out the stack variable using print(). For each character:
   - If it's an opening parenthesis, push it onto the stack.
   - If it's a closing parenthesis, check against the last opening parenthesis in the stack for a match, and pop the stack if it matches.

4. Generate Closing Sequence: After processing all input characters, any remaining open parentheses in the stack need to be closed in reverse order (LIFO).

5. Construct and Return the Completed Sequence: Formulate the sequence of closing parentheses to append to the original sequence, ensuring that the overall structure is properly formed.

The stack is a natural choice for this problem, as it efficiently handles the LIFO order required for matching parentheses. Iterating over each character provides a step-by-step approach to build the final sequence. This method is effective and straightforward, ensuring correct matching and order of parentheses. The loop is used for iteration, and the stack manages the open parentheses, making the solution both clear and efficient for this task.

[Example 3]
Example task instances:
I have an oven, a bed, a lamp, a chair, a fridge, a microwave, and a toaster. How many objects do I have?

I have four couches, a bed, a table, and a lamp. How many objects do I have?

I have a goat, a frog, five pigs, and a bear. How many animals do I have?

Output Format:
A positive integer

Explanation:
This task involves identifying and counting specific types of objects (fruits or vegetables) from a mixed list. The primary challenge is correctly categorizing each item in the list and then tallying the counts of the desired categories.

Analyzing the Task:
1. Object Categorization: Determining whether each item in the list is a fruit, a vegetable, or neither. This requires knowledge of common fruits and vegetables.

2. Counting Objects: Accurately counting the number of items in each category. This may involve handling singular and plural forms, as well as numerical phrases (e.g., "two peaches").

3. Handling Varied Input: The input text may vary in format and content, requiring flexible parsing to extract the necessary information.

Constructing the Code Prompt:
1. Extracting Objects from Input: The first step is parsing the input text to create a list of objects. This requires string manipulation and possibly natural language processing techniques.

2. Extracting the Question: Determine what category of items needs to be counted (e.g., fruits, vegetables) from the input text. 

3. Initializing Count Variables: Set up a variable to keep track of the total count of the desired objects.

4. [Important] Counting Each Object: Iterate over each object, determine if it belongs to the desired category (fruit or vegetable), and count it. This process shoud be logged with print() function. This involves:
   - Identifying singular and plural forms.
   - Recognizing and handling numerical phrases.
   - Keeping a running total of the count.

5. Returning the Total Count: After processing all objects, return the total count as the answer.
