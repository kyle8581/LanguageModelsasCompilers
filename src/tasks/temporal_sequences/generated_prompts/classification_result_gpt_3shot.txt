For the task instances where the timeline of events needs to be analyzed to determine the possible time of arrival at a specific location, the variables tracking approach would be more effective. This is because the task involves processing each event in chronological order and keeping track of the time intervals to determine the possible time of arrival at the destination. Using variables tracking, you can keep track of the time intervals and events to narrow down the possible time range for each individual. Therefore, the answer is Variables tracking.
