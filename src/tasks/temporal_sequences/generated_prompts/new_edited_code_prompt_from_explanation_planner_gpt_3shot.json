Implement the code prompt as much as you can and describe the logic in code following the provided explanation but do not make a code that is biased toward a single task example instance. For example, do not use hard-coded variables that are obtained from task instances (e.g., using specific name of person in the question). The code prompt must be able to be applied to various instances of same task. When returning the final answer, carefully consider the output format. Especially, for the multiple choice questions, the final answer should be one of the given options. The main function name should be 'solve_temporal_sequences_quiz'. Along with the main function, you may want to define some helper functions that might be helpful for implementing the 'solve_temporal_sequences_quiz'. But you don't have to explicitly implement the helper functions, but just define them with function name and a single-line explanation in comment.",
