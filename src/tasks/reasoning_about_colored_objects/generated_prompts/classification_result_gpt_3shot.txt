For the tasks involving colors and objects arrangement, the free format reasoning would be more effective. This is because the logic required to determine the color or position of objects is not easily expressed in a step-by-step manner. Instead, a more abstract and flexible approach is needed to reason through the relationships between the objects. Therefore, the free format reasoning would be the better strategy to tackle these tasks. So the answer is Free format reasoning.
