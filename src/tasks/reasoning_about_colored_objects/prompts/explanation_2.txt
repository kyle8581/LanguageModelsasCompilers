This task involves solving questions related to the color, count, and spatial arrangement of objects. The challenge lies in accurately parsing the input to extract relevant information and applying logical reasoning to determine the correct answer.

Analyzing the Task:
The task includes several types of question(i.e. color identification, counting objects, spatial reasoning) which is difficult to deal with a specific method. Therefore, the free format reasoning approach would be effective to tackle the task.

Constructing the Code Prompt:
1. Extracting Object Properties: Parse the input text to create a list of objects with their associated properties and positions.

2. Identifying the Question: Extract the specific question from the input text and determine its type (color identification, counting, or spatial reasoning).

3. Listing Options: Extract the list of possible answers provided in the input text.

4. [Free format reasoning] Derive answer with its reasons: Process the appropriate logic according to the question type and derive the answer. Use abstract function(i.e. derive_answer_with_explanation) which outputs the proper reason and answer for the task.

5. Determining the Answer: Match the result of the logical processing with the options to identify the correct answer.

6. Returning the Final Answer: Return the matched option as the final answer to the question.
